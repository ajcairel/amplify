## About

This application was built using Amazon Amplify. I built this to get familiar with AWS, the CI/CD workflow it offers, as well as the Amplify CLI. Some other implemented technologies:
    - Amazon Cognito (managed identity service)
    - GraphQL API
    - AWS AppSync (managed GraphQL service)
    - Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL database)
    - Amazon S3 (storage service)
